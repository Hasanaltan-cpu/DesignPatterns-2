<h4>Design Patterns-2<h4>
<p>Total patterns will implement on BaseProject.Moreover in BaseProject,was created with carefully in terms of Inversion Of Control & Dependency Inversion Principle.</p>

[1-Strategy Design Pattern](https://github.com/Hasanaltan-cpu/DesignPatterns-2/tree/master/WebApp.StrategyDP)
<p>Main Goal Of Strategy Design Pattern : This design pattern provides us to change object's behaviour on the run time.</p>
<p>In this scenario,we have two database for using and we give chance to user can switch which database want.I use two database.One of them is SqlServer,another is MongoDb.
By using Strategy Design Pattern, u don't need to change database on compile time,u can easily change database on run time with dinamically.</p>

<h4>Requirements :<h4>

*  MongoDbAtlas
* SqlServer
* EntityFramework Core
* EntityFramework Core Identity
* EntityFramework Core SqlServer
* EntityFramework Core Tools

  [2-ChainofResponsibility Design Pattern](https://github.com/Hasanaltan-cpu/DesignPatterns-2/tree/master/WebApp.ChainOfResponsibilityDP)

  <p>Main Goal Of ChainofResponsibility Design Pattern : This design pattern provides us to bind our all process moreover seperate this process to step by step.With this way , when u want to add new part or new behaviour to your application, you can easily add a new chain in addition to that gives a chance to modify your step.</p>
  <p>In this scenario, we have 3 steps. This means our application has 3 chains:
     </p>
  
 * Excell Process
 * Zip Process
 * E-mail Process
